4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

3. Click "**Create API Key**"
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Hood Eatery Development")

7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Save it somewhere safe - you won't see it again!

### Step 3: Add to Your .env File
Open your backend `.env` file and add:

```env
# Resend Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=Hood Eatery <onboarding@resend.dev>
ADMIN_EMAIL=macleaann723@gmail.com
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `re_your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual API key from Resend
- Keep `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender for testing (this is provided by Resend for free)
- The `ADMIN_EMAIL` is where support messages will be sent

### Step 4: Restart Your Backend Server
```bash
# Stop your server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Test It!
1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Go to the Contact page

2. Click "**Domains**"
3. Click "**Add Domain**"
4. Enter your domain (e.g., `hoodeatery.com`)

### Step 2: Add DNS Records
Resend will show you DNS records to add:
1. Copy the DNS records
2. Go to your domain provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy)
3. Add the DNS records
4. Wait for verification (usually a few minutes)

### Step 3: Update Your .env
```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=Hood Eatery <noreply@hoodeatery.com>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email not received?
1. **Check spam folder** - Emails might go to spam initially
2. **Check API key** - Make sure it starts with `re_` and is correct
3. **Check backend logs** - Look for error messages in terminal
4. **Verify email** - Make sure the recipient email is valid

### "Invalid API key" error?
- Double-check your API key in the `.env` file
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Restart your backend server after adding the key

### "Domain not verified" error?
- You're probably trying to use a custom domain that's not verified
- Use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing
- Or verify your domain following the steps above

### Rate limit exceeded?
